    <!-- Display concept consist of:
    a)Block, b)Inline, c)Inline Block
    a)block:it will not allow any other tag or element aside to it as it will have full border of that element. As it will 
    not allow any other element in it rows and the another block get shifted below. block does not allow anyone in it row.
    And we can also increase width and height of it.
    b)Inline: it allows the another block to come in it rows (right or left). but if there are two inline elements one upon another
    and they are both inline it will not increase the size as width and height as they are inline.
    And then the picture comes as "block inline".
    c)block inline: it helps the inline to increase the width and height of the block. and for block we can state it as inline block by calling inline block.

    <!-- Flex:
    it changes the child alignment to the positin where we want throught selecting the parent where the alignment will happen.
    There are two axis here: a)x-axis or main axis, b)y-axis or cross axis.
    a) X-axis: it runs in a row from left to right or vice versa. In x-axis the justify content is used.
    b) Y-axis: it runs from top to bottom. In y-axis the align items is used.
